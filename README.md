## Task Description

The Application "E-commerce-Backend" is the backend part powered by express.js and sequelize to interact with the retailers database. The task is made to understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce platforms in order to become a full stack web developer. The application allows the user to perform different request on the database to get categories, products and its product tags as well as update, and delete data from the database. As the application represents only the backend of the retailers webpage we can use the code with Insomnia in order to perform the previously named methods.
